# Subscribing to Channels

## Subscribe

To begin receiving feed messages, you must first send a subscribe message to the server indicating which channels and contracts to subscribe for.

To specify contracts within each channel, just pass a list of symbols inside the channel payload. Mention ***["all"]*** in symbols if you want to receive updates across all the contracts. Please note that snapshots are sent only for specified symbols,meaning no snapshots are sent for symbol: ***"all"***.

Once a subscribe message is received the server will respond with a subscriptions message that lists all channels you are subscribed to. Subsequent subscribe messages will add to the list of subscriptions. 

> Subscription Sample

```
// Request
// Subscribe to BTCUSD_28Dec and ETHBTC_28Dec with the ticker and orderbookL2 channels,
{
    "type": "subscribe",
    "payload": {
        "channels": [
            {
                "name": "ticker",
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSD_28Dec",
                    "ETHBTC_28Dec"
                ]
            },
            {

                ]
            }
        ]
    }

        }
    ]
}
```


## Unsubscribe

If you want to unsubscribe from channel/contracts pairs, send an "unsubscribe" message. The structure is equivalent to subscribe messages. If you want to unsubscribe for specific symbols in a channel, you can pass it in the symbol list. As a shorthand you can also provide no symbols for a channel, which will unsubscribe you from the channel entirely.

> Unsubscribe Sample

```
// Request
{
    "type": "unsubscribe",
    "payload": {
        "channels": [
            {
                "name": "ticker",          // unsubscribe from ticker channel only for BTCUSD_28Dec
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSD_28Dec"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "l2_orderbook"      // unsubscribe from all symbols for l2_orderbook channel
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Authenticating a connection

Authentication allows clients to receives private messages, like trading notifications. Examples of the trading notifications are: fills, liquidations, [adl](/#trading-notitifications) and pnl updates.

To authenticate, you need to send a signed request of type 'auth' on your socket connection. Check the authentication section above for more details on how to sign a request using api key and secret.

The payload for the signed request will be
'GET' + timestamp + '/live'

To subscribe to private channels, the client needs to first send an auth event, providing api-key, and signature. 

> Authentication sample

```python
# auth message with signed request
import websocket
import hashlib
import hmac
import time

api_key = 'a207900b7693435a8fa9230a38195d'
api_secret = '7b6f39dcf660ec1c7c664f612c60410a2bd0c258416b498bf0311f94228f'

def generate_signature(secret, message):
    message = bytes(message, 'utf-8')
    secret = bytes(secret, 'utf-8')
    hash = hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha256)
    return hash.hexdigest()

# Get open orders
method = 'GET'
timestamp = str(int(time.time()))
path = '/live'
signature_data = method + timestamp + path
signature = generate_signature(api_secret, signature_data)

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp('wss://socket.delta.exchange')
ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": "auth",
    "payload": {
        "api-key": api_key,
        "signature": signature,
        "timestamp": timestamp
    }
}))
```

```nodejs

```

To unsubscribe from all private channels, just send a 'unauth' message on the socket. This will automatically unsubscribe the connection from all authenticated channels.

```python
ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": 'unauth',
    "payload": {}
}))

```

# Detecting Connection Drops
Some client libraries might not detect connection drops properly. We provide two methods for the clients to ensure they are connected and getting subscribed data.

## Heartbeat (Recommended)
The client can enable heartbeat on the socket. If heartbeat is enabled, the server is expected to periodically send a heartbeat message to the client. Right now, the heartbeat time is set to 30 seconds. 

### How to Implement on client side

- Enable heartbeat (check sample code) after each successful socket connection
- Set a timer with duration of 35 seconds (We take 5 seconds buffer for heartbeat to arrive).
- When you receive a new heartbeat message, you reset the timer
- If the timer is called, that means the client didn't receive any heartbeat in last 35 seconds. In this case, the client should exit the existing connection and try to reconnect. 

```
// Enable Heartbeat on successful connection
ws.send({
    "type": "enable_heartbeat"
})

// Disable Heartbeat
ws.send({
    "type": "disable_heartbeat"
})

// Sample Heartbeat message received periodically by client
{
    "type": "heartbeat"
}
```


## Ping/Pong
The client can periodically (~ every 30 seconds) send a ping frame or a raw ping message and the server will respond back with a pong frame or a raw pong response. If the client doesn't receive a pong response in next 5 seconds, the client should exit the existing connection and try to reconnect. 

```
// Ping Request
ws.send({
    "type": "ping"
})

// Pong Response
ws.send({
    "type": "pong"
})
```

# Public Channels

## v2 ticker

The ticker channel provides **price change data** for the last **24 hrs** (rolling window).  
It is published every **5 seconds**.

To subscribe to the ticker channel, you need to send the list of **symbols** for which you would like to receive updates.

You can also subscribe to ticker updates for a **category of products** by sending a list of [category names](/#schemaproductcategories).  
For example, to receive updates for **put options** and **futures**, use the following format:  
```
{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}
```

If you would like to subscribe to all listed contracts, pass:  
```
{ "symbols": ["all"] }
```

**Important:**  
If you subscribe to the ticker channel without specifying a symbols list, you will **not** receive any data.

### How to maintain orderbook locally using this channel:

1) When you subscribe to this channel, the first message with "action"= "snapshot" resembles the complete l2_orderbook at this time. "asks" and "bids" are arrays of ["price", "size"]. (size is number of contracts at this price)

2) After the initial snapshot, messages will be with "action" = "update", resembling the difference between current and previous orderbook state. "asks" and "bids" are arrays of ["price", "new size"]. "asks" are sorted in increasing order of price. "bids" are sorted in decreasing order of price. This is true for both "snapshot" and "update" messages.

3) "sequence_no" field must be used to check if any messages were dropped. "sequence_no" must be +1 of the last message.  
e.g. In the snapshot message it is 6199, and the update message has 6200. The next update message must have 6201. In case of sequence_no mismatch, resubscribe to the channel, and start from the beginning.

4) If sequence_no is correct, edit the in-memory orderbook using the "update" message.  
Case 1: price already exists, new size is 0 -> Delete this price level.  
Case 2: price already exists, new size isn't 0 -> Replace the old size with new size.  
Case 3: price doesn’t exists -> insert the price level.  
e.g. for the shown snapshot and update messages to create the new orderbook: in the ask side, price level of "16919.0" will be deleted. Size at price level "16919.5" will be changed from "1193" to "710". In the bids side there was no price level of "16918.5", so add a new level of "16918.5" of size "304". Other price levels from the snapshot will remain the same.

5) If "action":"error" message is received, resubscribe this symbol after a few seconds. Can occur in rare cases, e.g. Failed to send "action":"snapshot" message after subscribing due to a race condition, instead an "error" message will be sent.

Checksum: Using this, users can verify the accuracy of orderbook data created using l2_updates. checksum is the "cs" key in the message payload.  
Steps to calculate checksum:  
1) Edit the old in-memory orderbook with the "update" message received.  
2) Create asks_string and bids_string as shown below. where priceN = price at Nth level, sizeN = size at Nth level. Asks are sorted in increasing order and bids in decreasing order by price.  
asks_string = price0:size0,price1:size1,…,price9:size9  
bids_string = price0:size0,price1:size1,…,price9:size9  
checksum_string = asks_string + "|" + bids_string  
Only consider the first 10 price levels on both sides. If orderbook as less than 10 levels, use only them.  
e.g. If after applying the update, the new orderbook becomes ->  
asks = [["100.00", "23"], ["100.05", "34"]]  
bids = [["99.04", "87"], ["98.65", "102"], ["98.30", "16"]]  
checksum_string = "100.00:23,100.05:34|99.04:87,98.65:102,98.30:16"  
3) Calculate the CRC32 value (32-bit unsigned integer) of checksum_string. This should be equal to the checksum provided in the “update” message.

### Market Disruption
When markets are disrupted, orderbook enters into cancel only mode. You can refer to "trading_status" field in product info to determine this. In cancel only mode, you can only cancel your orders. No matching happens in this mode.

### Auction Started
When markets need to come up, we conduct a single price auction. In this case, orderbook enters into post only mode. In post only mode, you can post new orders, cancel exisiting orders, add more margin to open positions. No matching happens in this mode. It is possible to see an overlap between asks and bids during this time.


### Auction Finished
When auction finishes, markets enter into operational mode and trading continues as usual. 

You can read more about the single price auction [here](https://global.delta.exchange/blog/bootstrapping-liquidity-using-auctions/)

## UserTrades
Please use "v2/user_trades" channel for better latency.

Channel provides updates for fills. Need to pass list of product symbols while subscribing.

All updates will have incremental seq_id. seq_id is separate for each symbol.

Auto Deleverage Liquidations of a position can be tracked by reason: "adl" in the user_trades channel.
You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to user trades channel. You can also subscribe to user trades
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.
If you would like to subscribe for all the listed contracts, pass: `{ "symbols": ["all"] }`.
Please note that if you subscribe to user trades channel without specifying the symbols list, you will not receive any data.

## v2/user_trades
Channel provides updates for fills. Need to pass list of product symbols while subscribing. This channel is similar to user_trades channel, only difference is that, it is faster than user_trades and doesn't contain commission data.

All updates will have incremental sequence_id. sequence_id is separate for each symbol, useful for identifying if any v2/user_trades messages were missed/dropped. The sequence_id will reset to 1 after our systems restart. (usually after maintainaince/market disruption).

Auto Deleverage Liquidations of a position can be tracked by reason: "adl" in the user_trades channel.
You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to v2/user_trades channel. You can also subscribe to v2/user_trades
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.

## PortfolioMargins
Channel provides updates for portfolio margin values of the selected sub-account. These updates are sent every 2 seconds. In case portfolio margin is not enabled on the selected sub-account, no updates will be sent on this channel.

For detailed description of portfolio margin please see [user guide](https://guides.delta.exchange/delta-exchange-user-guide/trading-guide/margin-explainer/portfolio-margin)

UCF: is unrealised cashflows of your portfolio. These are the cashflows (negative for outgoing and positive for incoming) that will take place if all the positions in your portfolio are closed at prevailing mark prices.

Keys - 

<dl>
    <dt>index_symbol</dt>
    <dd>This is the coin on which portfolio margin is enabled.</dd>
    <dt>positions_upl</dt>
    <dd>This is unrealised cashflows (UCF) of your portfolio. These are the cashflows (negative for outgoing and positive for incoming) that will take place if all the positions in your portfolio are closed at prevailing mark prices. Unrealised cashflow is positive for long options and negative for short options.</dd>
    <dt>im_w_ucf</dt>
    <dd>This is the initial margin (IM) requirement for the portfolio. IM is computed as max(risk_margin, margin_floor) - UCF.</dd>
    <dd>If UCF > max(risk_margin, margin_floor) then IM is negative. Negative margin requirement results in increase in your balance available for trading.</dd>
    <dd>If the Wallet Balance (ex spot orders) is less than IM then you would only be able to place orders that reduce the risk of the portfolio.</dd>
    <dt>im_wo_ucf</dt>
    <dd>This is IM without UCF.</dd>
    <dt>mm_w_ucf</dt>
    <dd>This is the maintenance margin (MM) requirement for the portfolio. MM is computed as 80% * max(risk_margin, margin_floor) - UCF.</dd>
    <dd>If the Wallet Balance (ex spot orders) is less than MM then the portfolio will go into liquidation.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt>mm_wo_ucf</dt>
    <dd>This is MM without UCF.</dd>
    <dt>commission</dt>
    <dd>This is the trading fees blocked for the open orders/positions (for closing the positions) in the portfolio.</dd>
    <dd>This is in addition to the IM requirement.</dd>
    <dt>blocked_margin</dt>
    <dd>The margin actually blocked for your portfolio. If your Wallet Balance (ex spot orders) is greater than IM + commission then blocked_margin = IM + commissions. Otherwise blocked_margin is equal to the maximum amout we are able to block to meet the portfolio margin requirement.</dd>
    <dd>If blocked_margin < MM then the portfolio goes into liquidation.</dd>
    <dt>liquidation_risk</dt>
    <dd>This flag indicates if the portfolio is at liquidation risk.</dd>
    <dd>This flag is set to TRUE when blocked_margin < im_w_ucf + commissions.</dd>
    <dt>under_liquidation</dt>
    <dd>This flag is set to TRUE when the portfolio is under liquidation.</dd>
    <dt>margin_shortfall</dt>
    <dd>This is the minimum topup amount needed to bring the portfolio out of liquidation risk state.</dd>
    <dt>risk_margin</dt>
    <dd>The maximum likely loss of the portfolio under the various simulated stress scenarios.</dd>
    <dt>risk_matrix</dt>
    <dd>Matrix showing the profit/loss of the portfolio under various simulated stress scenarios.</dd>
    <dd> Profit/loss for each position and open order is computed with reference to the prevailing mark prices. Positive numbers indicate profit and negative numbers indicate loss.</dd>
    <dt>margin_floor</dt>
    <dd>Margin Floor is the minimum risk_margin required for a portfolio. </dd>
    <dd>It is comprised of sum of futures_margin_floor, long_options_margin_floor, short_options_margin_floor</dd>
