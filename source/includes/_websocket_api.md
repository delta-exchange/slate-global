# Websocket Feed

Websocket api can be used for the following use cases

- Get real time feed of market data, this includes L2 orderbook and recent trades.
- Get price feeds - Mark prices of different contracts, price feed of underlying indexes etc.
- Get account specific notifications like fills, liquidations, [ADL](https://global.delta.exchange/user-guide/docs/trading-guide/ADL/) and PnL updates.
- Get account specific updates on orders, positions and wallets.

There is a limit of 150 connections every 5 minutes per IP address. A connection attempt that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected with 429 HTTP status error. On receiving this error, wait for 5 to 10 minutes before making new connection requests.

You will be disconnected, if there is no activity within 60 seconds after making connection.

# Subscribing to Channels

## Subscribe

To begin receiving feed messages, you must first send a subscribe message to the server indicating which channels and contracts to subscribe for.

To specify contracts within each channel, just pass a list of symbols inside the channel payload. Mention ***["all"]*** in symbols if you want to receive updates across all the contracts. Please note that snapshots are sent only for specified symbols,meaning no snapshots are sent for symbol: ***"all"***.

Once a subscribe message is received the server will respond with a subscriptions message that lists all channels you are subscribed to. Subsequent subscribe messages will add to the list of subscriptions. 

> Subscription Sample

```json
// Request

```


## Unsubscribe

If you want to unsubscribe from channel/contracts pairs, send an "unsubscribe" message. The structure is equivalent to subscribe messages. If you want to unsubscribe for specific symbols in a channel, you can pass it in the symbol list. As a shorthand you can also provide no symbols for a channel, which will unsubscribe you from the channel entirely.

> Unsubscribe Sample

```json
// Request
{
    "type": "unsubscribe",
    "payload": {
        "channels": [
            {
                "name": "v2/ticker",          // unsubscribe from ticker channel only for BTCUSD_28Dec
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSDT"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "l2_orderbook"      // unsubscribe from all symbols for l2_orderbook channel
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Authenticating a connection

Authentication allows clients to receives private messages, like trading notifications. Examples of the trading notifications are: fills, liquidations, [adl](/#trading-notitifications) and pnl updates.

To authenticate, you need to send a signed request of type 'auth' on your socket connection. Check the authentication section above for more details on how to sign a request using api key and secret.

The payload for the signed request will be
'GET' + timestamp + '/live'

To subscribe to private channels, the client needs to first send an auth event, providing api-key, and signature. 

> Authentication sample

```python
# auth message with signed request
import websocket
import hashlib
import hmac
import time

api_key = 'a207900b7693435a8fa9230a38195d'
api_secret = '7b6f39dcf660ec1c7c664f612c60410a2bd0c258416b498bf0311f94228f'

def generate_signature(secret, message):
    message = bytes(message, 'utf-8')
    secret = bytes(secret, 'utf-8')
    hash = hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha256)
    return hash.hexdigest()

# Get open orders
method = 'GET'
timestamp = str(int(time.time()))
path = '/live'
signature_data = method + timestamp + path
signature = generate_signature(api_secret, signature_data)

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp('wss://socket.delta.exchange')
ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": "auth",
    "payload": {
        "api-key": api_key,
        "signature": signature,
        "timestamp": timestamp
    }
}))
```

```nodejs

```

To unsubscribe from all private channels, just send a 'unauth' message on the socket. This will automatically unsubscribe the connection from all authenticated channels.

```python
ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": 'unauth',
    "payload": {}
}))
```

# Sample Python Code

## Public Channels

**Summary:** 
The python script(right panel) connects to the Delta Exchange WebSocket to receive real-time market data.

- It opens a connection.
- Subscribes to `v2/ticker`(tickers data) and `candlestick_1m`(1 minute ohlc candlesticks) channels. (**MARK:BTCUSDT** - mark price ohlc in candlesticks channel)
- When data arrives, it processes and prints it.
- If an error occurs, it prints an error message.
- If the connection closes, it notifies the user.
- The connection remains open indefinitely to keep receiving updates.

```python
import websocket
import json

# production websocket base url
WEBSOCKET_URL = "wss://socket.delta.exchange"

def on_error(ws, error):
    print(f"Socket Error: {error}")

def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
    print(f"Socket closed with status: {close_status_code} and message: {close_msg}")

def on_open(ws):
  print(f"Socket opened")
  # subscribe tickers of perpetual futures - BTCUSD & ETHUSD, call option C-BTC-95200-200225 and put option - P-BTC-95200-200225
  subscribe(ws, "v2/ticker", ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "C-BTC-95200-200225", "P-BTC-95200-200225"])
  # subscribe 1 minute ohlc candlestick of perpetual futures - MARK:BTCUSD(mark price) & ETHUSD(ltp), call option C-BTC-95200-200225(ltp) and put option - P-BTC-95200-200225(ltp).
  subscribe(ws, "candlestick_1m", ["MARK:BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "C-BTC-95200-200225", "P-BTC-95200-200225"])

def subscribe(ws, channel, symbols):
    payload = {

                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(payload))

def on_message(ws, message):
    # print json response
    message_json = json.loads(message)
    print(message_json)

  ws.on_open = on_open
  ws.run_forever() # runs indefinitely
```

## Private Channels

**Summary:** 
The python script(right panel) connects to the Delta Exchange WebSocket to receive real-time market data.

- It opens a connection.
- Sends authentication payload over socket with api_key, signature & timestamp.
- When authentication update arrives, it checks for success and then sends subscription for `orders` and `positions` channels for all contracts.
- Prints all other updates in json format.
- If an error occurs, it prints an error message.
- If the connection closes, it notifies the user.
- The connection remains open indefinitely to keep receiving updates.

```python
import websocket

# Detecting Connection Drops
Some client libraries might not detect connection drops properly. We provide two methods for the clients to ensure they are connected and getting subscribed data.

## Heartbeat (Recommended)
The client can enable heartbeat on the socket. If heartbeat is enabled, the server is expected to periodically send a heartbeat message to the client. Right now, the heartbeat time is set to 30 seconds. 

### How to Implement on client side

- Enable heartbeat (check sample code) after each successful socket connection
- Set a timer with duration of 35 seconds (We take 5 seconds buffer for heartbeat to arrive).
- When you receive a new heartbeat message, you reset the timer
- If the timer is called, that means the client didn't receive any heartbeat in last 35 seconds. In this case, the client should exit the existing connection and try to reconnect. 

```python
// Enable Heartbeat on successful connection
ws.send({
    "type": "enable_heartbeat"
})

// Disable Heartbeat
ws.send({
    "type": "disable_heartbeat"
})

// Sample Heartbeat message received periodically by client
{
    "type": "heartbeat"
}
```


## Ping/Pong
The client can periodically (~ every 30 seconds) send a ping frame or a raw ping message and the server will respond back with a pong frame or a raw pong response. If the client doesn't receive a pong response in next 5 seconds, the client should exit the existing connection and try to reconnect. 

```python
// Ping Request
ws.send({
    "type": "ping"
})

// Pong Response
ws.send({
    "type": "pong"
})
```

# Public Channels

## ticker
This channel is available on the new public api websocket endpoint.

**ticker** channel provides **price change data** for the last **24 hrs** (rolling window).  
It is published every **5 seconds**.

To subscribe to the ticker channel, you need to send the list of **symbols** for which you would like to receive updates.

You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to this channel. You can also subscribe to this channel for all symbols in an Option Chain. e.g. To subscribe to all Put and Call Options updates for BTC Options expiring on 31st March 2026, send symbol = "BTC-310326". ("ASSET-DDMMYY") 

**Important:**  
If you subscribe to the ticker channel without specifying a symbols list, you will **not** receive any data.

### How to maintain orderbook locally using this channel:

1) When you subscribe to this channel, the first message with "action"= "snapshot" resembles the complete orderbook at this time. json_key "a" (asks) and json_key "b" (bids) are arrays of ["price", "size"]. (size is number of contracts at this price)

2) After the initial snapshot, messages will be with "action" = "update", resembling the difference between current and previous orderbook state. "asks" and "bids" are arrays of ["price", "new size"]. "asks" are sorted in increasing order of price. "bids" are sorted in decreasing order of price. This is true for both "snapshot" and "update" messages.

3) "seq" (sequence_no) field must be used to check if any messages were dropped. "sequence_no" must be +1 of the last message.  
e.g. In the snapshot message it is 6199, and the update message has 6200. The next update message must have 6201. In case of sequence_no mismatch, resubscribe to the channel, and start from the beginning.

4) If sequence_no is correct, edit the in-memory orderbook using the "update" message.  
Case 1: price already exists, new size is 0 -> Delete this price level.  
Case 2: price already exists, new size isn't 0 -> Replace the old size with new size.  
Case 3: price doesn't exists -> insert the price level.  
e.g. for the shown snapshot and update messages to create the new orderbook: in the ask side, price level of "16919.0" will be deleted. Size at price level "16919.5" will be changed from "1193" to "710". In the bids side there was no price level of "16918.5", so add a new level of "16918.5" of size "304". Other price levels from the snapshot will remain the same.

5) If "action":"error" message is received, resubscribe this symbol after a few seconds. Can occur in rare cases, e.g. Failed to send "action":"snapshot" message after subscribing due to a race condition, instead an "error" message will be sent.

Checksum: Using this, users can verify the accuracy of orderbook data created using ob_updates. checksum is the "cs" key in the message payload.  
Steps to calculate checksum:  
1) Edit the old in-memory orderbook with the "update" message received.  
2) Create asks_string and bids_string as shown below. where priceN = price at Nth level, sizeN = size at Nth level. Asks are sorted in increasing order and bids in decreasing order by price.  
asks_string = price0:size0,price1:size1,…,price9:size9  
bids_string = price0:size0,price1:size1,…,price9:size9  
checksum_string = asks_string + "|" + bids_string  
Only consider the first 10 price levels on both sides. If orderbook as less than 10 levels, use only them.  
e.g. If after applying the update, the new orderbook becomes ->  
asks = [["100.00", "23"], ["100.05", "34"]]  
bids = [["99.04", "87"], ["98.65", "102"], ["98.30", "16"]]  
checksum_string = "100.00:23,100.05:34|99.04:87,98.65:102,98.30:16"  
3) Calculate the CRC32 value (32-bit unsigned integer) of checksum_string. This should be equal to the checksum provided in the "update" message.

### Market Disruption
When markets are disrupted, orderbook enters into cancel only mode. You can refer to "trading_status" field in product info to determine this. In cancel only mode, you can only cancel your orders. No matching happens in this mode.

### Auction Started
When markets need to come up, we conduct a single price auction. In this case, orderbook enters into post only mode. In post only mode, you can post new orders, cancel exisiting orders, add more margin to open positions. No matching happens in this mode. It is possible to see an overlap between asks and bids during this time.


### Auction Finished
When auction finishes, markets enter into operational mode and trading continues as usual. 

You can read more about the single price auction [here](https://global.delta.exchange/blog/bootstrapping-liquidity-using-auctions/)

snapshot → This event is sent as soon as you subscribe to the system_status channel. The data in this event contains the current system status details.

1. "event": "maintenance_scheduled" is sent when maintenance is scheduled, usually 6 to 24 hours before the actual maintenance. It includes the estimated start and finish times.  
2. "event": "maintenance_started" is sent when maintenance begins. It indicates service disruption and includes the estimated finish time. For unscheduled maintenance, this event may be sent directly without the prior maintenance_scheduled event.  
3. "event": "maintenance_finished" is sent when maintenance is complete. Usually, after this event, there is an auction period lasting around 5 to 10 minutes.  
4. "event": "maintenance_cancelled" is sent when upcoming scheduled maintenance has been cancelled.

Note: Maintenance start and finish times are approximate estimates. The actual start time is confirmed by the maintenance_started event, and the actual completion is confirmed by the maintenance_finished event.

These values describe the current state of the entire system.

The payload["status"] describe the current state of the entire system. Below are the possible values:

1. "live": The system is operating normally. All services (REST APIs, WebSocket, backend processes) are functioning as expected.  
2. "maintenance": The system is currently under maintenance. Some features or services may be temporarily unavailable or disrupted.  
3. "api_fallback": Our system might be facing some technical issues, but most core functions remain available. Mostly used by our internal system. You can treat this as "live" mode, and check with our support team.  
4. "degraded_mode": Our system might be facing some technical issues, but most core functions remain available. Mostly used by our internal system. You can treat this as "live" mode, and check with our support team.  

Changing status to between these three: ["api_fallback", "degraded_mode", "live"] is done by sending message with 

"event":  "app_status_update".

e.g. payload = %{type: "system_status", event: "app_status_update", status: "api_fallback", maintenance_announcement_time: time, maintenance_start_time: time, maintenance_finish_time: time, timestamp: current_time}

Note: The "app_status_update" messages will still contain correct maintenance related timestamps.

In addition to the event field, the status field reflects the overall system state, such as: live, maintenance, api_fallback, or degraded_mode.
All timestamps are in epoch microseconds.

# Private Channels

Private channels require clients to authenticate.

## Margins
This channel provides updates on wallet balances. Updates are sent for a specific asset whenever there is a change in wallet balances and margins for that asset.

## Positions
This channel provides updates whenever there is any change in your open positions.

A snapshot of current open position will be sent after subscribing a symbol, incremental updates will be sent on trade executions.
You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to positions channel. You can also subscribe to positions 
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.
If you would like to subscribe for all the listed contracts, pass: `{ "symbols": ["all"] }`.
Please note that if you subscribe to positions channel without specifying the symbols list, you will not receive any data.

## Orders
Channel provides updates when any order is updated for any action such as fill, quantity change. Need to pass list of product symbols while subscribing.

A snapshot of all open/pending orders will be sent after subscribing a symbol. And all incremental updates will be sent on create/update/delete of orders

Any of the following events can be tracked by the reason field in this channel

- fill
- stop_update
- stop_trigger
- stop_cancel
- liquidation
- self_trade


You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to orders channel. You can also subscribe to orders
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.

## UserTrades
Please use "v2/user_trades" channel for better latency.

Channel provides updates for fills. Need to pass list of product symbols while subscribing.

All updates will have incremental seq_id. seq_id is separate for each symbol.

Auto Deleverage Liquidations of a position can be tracked by reason: "adl" in the user_trades channel.
You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to user trades channel. You can also subscribe to user trades
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.
If you would like to subscribe for all the listed contracts, pass: `{ "symbols": ["all"] }`.

## v2/user_trades
Channel provides updates for fills. Need to pass list of product symbols while subscribing. This channel is similar to user_trades channel, only difference is that, it is faster than user_trades and doesn't contain commission data.

All updates will have incremental sequence_id. sequence_id is separate for each symbol, useful for identifying if any v2/user_trades messages were missed/dropped. The sequence_id will reset to 1 after our systems restart. (usually after maintainaince/market disruption).

Auto Deleverage Liquidations of a position can be tracked by reason: "adl" in the user_trades channel.
You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to v2/user_trades channel. You can also subscribe to v2/user_trades
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.

## PortfolioMargins
Channel provides updates for portfolio margin values of the selected sub-account. These updates are sent every 2 seconds. In case portfolio margin is not enabled on the selected sub-account, no updates will be sent on this channel.

For detailed description of portfolio margin please see [user guide](https://guides.delta.exchange/delta-exchange-user-guide/trading-guide/margin-explainer/portfolio-margin)

UCF: is unrealised cashflows of your portfolio. These are the cashflows (negative for outgoing and positive for incoming) that will take place if all the positions in your portfolio are closed at prevailing mark prices.

    <dt>positions_upl</dt>
    <dd>This is unrealised cashflows (UCF) of your portfolio. These are the cashflows (negative for outgoing and positive for incoming) that will take place if all the positions in your portfolio are closed at prevailing mark prices. Unrealised cashflow is positive for long options and negative for short options.</dd>
    <dt>im_w_ucf</dt>
    <dd>This is the initial margin (IM) requirement for the portfolio. IM is computed as max(risk_margin, margin_floor) - UCF.</dd>
    <dd>If UCF > max(risk_margin, margin_floor) then IM is negative. Negative margin requirement results in increase in your balance available for trading.</dd>
    <dd>If the Wallet Balance (ex spot orders) is less than IM then you would only be able to place orders that reduce the risk of the portfolio.</dd>
    <dt>im_wo_ucf</dt>
    <dd>This is IM without UCF.</dd>
    <dt>mm_w_ucf</dt>
    <dd>This is the maintenance margin (MM) requirement for the portfolio. MM is computed as 80% * max(risk_margin, margin_floor) - UCF.</dd>
