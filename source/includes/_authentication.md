# Authentication

Api endpoints that place orders or fetch account related information needs to authenticated using api key and api secret.



## Common Errors
**Note**
You should use ntp timestamp to sync local clocks in order to avoid following issue:

* ```{ "error: "SignatureExpired", message:"your signature has expired" }```

 Signature created in the last 5 seconds is allowed. if signature reaches delta system post 5 seconds of generation, then it will fail.

* ```{ "error": "InvalidApiKey", message: "Api Key not found"}```

  above error will be thrown if you are not using correct key, please check hostname e.g. erroneously Testnet.Delta.exchange api key have been used instead of Delta.exchange api key

* ```{ "error: "UnauthorizedApiAccess", message:"Api Key not authorised to access this endpoint" }```

  Check api key have required permissions like trading permission

* ```{"success": False, "error": {"code": "ip_blocked_for_api_key"}}```

  API call made from a machine with IP address that isn't whitelisted. Check the below docs for common issues and fixes.

## Generating an API Key

Before being able to sign any requests, you must create an API key via the Delta website. Upon creating a key you will receive api key and api secret, which you must remember and secure at your end. The Key and Secret will be randomly generated.

You can create a new API key from here :
[https://global.delta.exchange/app/account/manageapikeys](https://global.delta.exchange/app/account/manageapikeys)

To create an API key with Trading permissions, whitelisted IP(s) must be provided. API requests using this API key will only succeed, if made from a machine with an IP address that was whitelisted. Multiple IPs can be whitelisted for a single API key. IP values can take IPv4 and IPv6. Whitelisted IPs can be changed and updated from the same page.

Common issues:  
1. Your machine is using IPv6 instead of IPv4 or vice-versa. Disable the one that isnâ€™t whitelisted from your network settings or whitelist both.  
2. Your ISP may automatically change the IP address at your home, office about once a week. Update your whitelisted IP in such case.  
3. If you are using a Web Service/Cloud provider like AWS, assign a static public IPv4 address to your machine.  

## API Key Permissions

You can restrict the functionality of API keys. Before creating the key, you must choose what permissions you would like the key to have. The permissions are:

- Trading - Allow a key to have trading permissions. This includes placing new orders, cancelling orders, closing positions, changing margin & leverage.


## Creating a Request

All Authenticated requests must contain the following headers:

**api-key**: The api key as a string.

**signature**: The hex-encoded signature (see [Signing a Message](/#signing-a-message)).

**timestamp**: A timestamp for your request.


All request bodies should have content type application/json and be valid JSON.

## Signing a Message

The signature header is generated by creating a sha256 HMAC using the secret key on the prehash string **method + timestamp + requestPath + query params + body** (where + represents string concatenation) and convert output to hexdigest. The timestamp value is the same as the 'timestamp' header.

Signature created in the last 5 seconds is allowed. if signature reaches delta system post 5 seconds of generation, then it will fail.

```shell

# GET /orders
# queryString: product_id=1&state=open

# Generating signature:
